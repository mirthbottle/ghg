<h1> GHG Emissions Mapping</h1>
<h5> There are many ways to combat climate change since GHG emissions is a byproduct of most of our activities.  Does the transportation system or buildings result in more emissions?  Is it different for different states?  Is it because of the private sector, public sector, or residents?  Global GHG emissions can be organized by process, jurisdiction, products and services, industry, type of end user, company, etc.  Students and young professionals may be able to benefit from a visualization tool to help them choose between fields and specializations.</h5>
<h5>Below is an example of one way to visualize the total global GHG emissions using data from WRI (World Resources Institute).</h5>
<p>WRI, CAIT 2.0. 2014. Climate Analysis Indicators Tool: WRI's Climate Data Explorer. Washington, DC: World Resources Institute. Available at: <a href="http://cait2.wri.org">http://cait2.wri.org</a></p>
